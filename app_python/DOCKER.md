Docker creates a lightweight runtime environment to be able to run our applications regardless of the host operating system. While docker is secure, there are still some practices that help to make the whole process better. After doing some research, I found the following practices:  

- Update your Docker version regularly
- Maintain lean & clean containers 
- Configure APIs & network 
- Limit usage of system resources 
- Maintain host isolation 
- Filter system calls 
- Use only trusted images 
- Scan images regularly 
- Favor minimal base images 
- Implement least privileged user 
- Use a secrets management tool 
- Limit direct access to container files 
- Enable encrypted communication
