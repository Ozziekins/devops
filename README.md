### About The Project

Name: Ozioma Okonicha  
Group: B18-SE02  
Lab 1&2

### Built With

* Django python framework  
I chose to use this framework honestly because I have never used it before and was eager to explore it for the first time. Moreover, it enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Also, there are good debugging tools, logging is already set up, and there's a server that automatically restarts with file changes.
