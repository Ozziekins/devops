First of all, What is TF? Terraform is an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to build, change, and version infrastructure safely and efficiently. After doing my research, some of the best practices I found are as follows:  

- Run terraform command with var-file  
- Enable version control on terraform state files bucket  
- Manage S3 backend for tfstate files  
- Notes on S3  
- Manage multiple Terraform modules and environments easily with Terragrunt  
- Retrieve state meta data from a remote backend  
- Turn on debug when you need do troubleshooting  
- Use shared modules  
- Isolate environment  
- Use terraform import to include as many resources you can  
- Avoid hard coding the resources validate and format terraform code  
- Generate README for each module with input and output variables  
- Update terraform version  
- Run terraform in docker container  
- Run test  
- Quick start  
- Run test within docker container  
- Minimum AWS permissions necessary for a Terraform run  
- Tips to deal with lambda functions explanation  
- Usage of variable "self"  
- One more use case  
- Use pre-installed Terraform plugins
