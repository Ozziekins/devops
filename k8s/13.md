## Differences between the output of the command for replicas  

The K8s deployment works fine if we have only one single replica. However, if there were multiple replicas running, we will encounter problems.

When using StatefulSet and PersistentVolumeClaim, use the `volumeClaimTemplates`: field in the StatefulSet. The `volumeClaimTemplates:` will be used to create unique PVCs for each replica, and they have unique naming ending with e.g. `-0` where the number is an ordinal used for the replicas in a StatefulSet.

The reason for the difference in output is that when using statefulsets, each pod is created with a unique identifier and also each pod has its own persistent volume claim as specified in our template.

## Parallel launch

In order to launch or terminate all Pods in parallel, we just add `podManagementPolicy: "Parallel"` to our statefulSet and the result is as follows:

For our app ordering guarantee are unnecessary. This is because there is no unique logic we are trying to preserve and the data used by the pods are not dependent on each other or affect anything; it is identical, hence we don't need the ordering.
